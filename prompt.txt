I'm attaching two files:

My CV (cv_profile.txt) — my resume in document format
A profile template (cv_profile.txt) — a structured template used by a job-searching script

Please read my CV carefully and rewrite the cv_profile.txt template based on my actual experience, skills, and preferences.
The template has the following sections that you need to fill in:

CV PROFILE – name, role looking for, years of experience, tech stack, location, what I'm not looking for, extra notes
SEARCH SETTINGS – search keywords, location, and number of pages (keep defaults: 3 pages)
MATCHING RULES – boost keywords, penalize keywords, and extra instructions for job matching

Important rules:

Keep the exact same structure and format of the template
Keep all section headers and comment lines (lines starting with #) exactly as they are
Replace only the placeholder values (text inside [brackets]) with real values from my CV
For BOOST: add technologies and skills from my CV that I want to prioritize
For PENALIZE: add technologies or job types that don't match my profile
For EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS: add any smart matching rules based on my background
Do not add any explanation outside the file content — return only the updated file
